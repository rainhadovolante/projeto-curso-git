                A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie" target="_blank">cookie</a> is a baked or cooked food that is typically small, flat and sweet. 
                It usually contains flour, sugar and some type of oil or fat. 
                It may include other ingredients such as raisins, oats, chocolate chips, nuts, etc.

                Biscuit or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org./wiki/Cookie" target="_blank">cookie</a> variants include sandwich biscuits, such as custard creams, Jammie Dodgers, Bourbons and Oreos, with marshmallow or jam filling and sometimes dipped in chocolate or another sweet coating. 
                Cookies are often served with beverages such as milk, coffee or tea and sometimes "dunked", an approach which releases more flavour from confections by dissolving the sugars,[4] while also softening their texture. 
                Factory-made cookies are sold in grocery stores, convenience stores and vending machines. 
                Fresh-baked cookies are sold at bakeries and coffeehouses, with the latter ranging from small business-sized establishments to multinational corporations such as Starbucks.
